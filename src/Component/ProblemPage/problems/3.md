66 Brother recently discovered a new strategy to make him smart:**Eating Chocolate**. 

He is going to buy 2 bags of chocolate, each bags have n and m pieces of chocolate respectively.

He shoud follow some special rule to become smart  : 

In day one, he eat 1 piece of chocolate, day two 2 pieces, day three 3 pieces and etc...

He always choose the bag with more pieces of chocolate to eat, and he can choose chocolate from 1 

bag only because his mom told him to do so. For example, in day 4, n=2 and m=3, he can not eat

any more chocolate because none of the bag has at least 4 pieces of chocolate

After he can not eat any chocolate, that is the day he become smart. Do you know

how long to take 66 Brother to become smart?



**Example 1:**
```
Input: n=8 m=11

	day 1: 11-1=10  =>[8 10] 
	day 2: 10-2=8  =>[8 8] 
	day 3: 8-3=5  =>[5 8] 
	day 4: 8-4=4  =>[5 4] 
	day 5: 5-5=0  =>[0 4]
	day 6: [0,4] none of the bag have least 6 chocolate
```
